/// Represents the various statuses a cubit can have during its lifecycle.

/// This enum is used to track and emit different states:
/// - [failure]: Indicates that the cubit has encountered an error.
/// - [initial]: The initial state before any data has been loaded.
/// - [loading]: Data is currently being fetched.
/// - [success]: Data has been successfully loaded.

///
/// The [DashboardState] is designed to be generic, with [T] representing the
/// type of data that is managed by each specific cubit state (e.g., balances,
/// transactions, etc.). Subclasses like `BalanceState` extend this class to
/// handle specific data types.
///
/// The state includes:
/// - [status]: A [CubitStatus] that indicates the current state (loading, success, etc.).
/// - [data]: The data of type [T] that is managed by the cubit.
/// - [error]: An optional [error] object that contains error details if the cubit is in a failure state.
